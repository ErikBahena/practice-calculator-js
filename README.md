Hello to you.

This is a simple practice calculator, modeled after the apple design.

I really had a great time building this project. I mainly used this project to re

These are some things I was able to practice:
1.JS
-Dom manipulation, changing textContent, and getting element values for calculations
-Array manipulation, splice, sort, and indexOf methods -Guard clauses
-Event listeners
-Constructor functions
-Constructor methods and properties
-Bind(this), binding the this keyword when calling certian functions
-Event delegation, clicking on buttons that call the same functions. It's better to have one function call instead of a lot of event listeners on every button
-building fairly complex logic

2.Html
-class specificity, there are some elements which require shared classes for styling and JS implementation.
-element structure, taking into consideration what type of placement each element will have and structuring the html in respect to that.

3.Css
-css grid, specifically working with grid area. I think its incredible.
-shared styling, adding the same stying to multiple elements
-id precedence, using element ids to make some styling more "important" than others.

Thank you for reviewing.
